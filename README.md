**Paper 1:** *Annual Report Readability, Current Earnings, and Earnings Persistence*

**Abstract:** This paper examines the relationship between annual report readability and firm performance and earnings persistence. I find that the annual reports of firms with lower earnings are harder to read (i.e., they have higher Fog and are longer). Moreover, the positive earnings of firms with annual reports that are easier to read are more persistent. This suggests that managers may be opportunistically choosing the readability of annual reports to hide adverse information from investors.

**Paper 2:** *Lexical Tightness and Text Complexity*

**Abstract:** We present a computational notion of Lexical Tightness that measures global cohesion of content words in a text. Lexical tightness represents the degree to which a text tends to use words that are highly inter-associated in the language. We demonstrate the utility of this measure for estimating text complexity as measured by US school grade level designations of texts. Lexical tightness strongly correlates with grade level in a collection of expertly rated reading materials. Lexical tightness captures aspects of prose 
complexity that are not covered by classic readability indexes, especially for literary texts. We also present initial findings on the utility of this measure for automated estimation of complexity for poetry.

**Bonus Paper:** *Improving Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) by Incorporating Significant Co-occurrence*

**Abstract:** We design a new co-occurrence based word association measure by incorporating the concept of significant cooccurrence in the popular word association measure Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI). By extensive experiments with a large number of publicly available datasets we show that the newly introduced measure performs better than other co-occurrence based measures.
